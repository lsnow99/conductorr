# Media Servers

Conductorr has special integrations for media servers that allow it to automatically inform the media servers of newly processed content, as well as retrieve all paths recognized by the media server as containing library content. Conductorr also attempts to identify instances when the media server incorrectly imports the content and notifies the user.
